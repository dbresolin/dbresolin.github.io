    <h1>My name is Daniel Bresolin.</h1>
    <p>I am seventeen years old. I am currently taking classes at Wake Tech Community College as part of the CCP program. I am planning on entering the field of engineering when I earn my degree. Until then, on top of Web, Programming, and Database Foundation, I will be taking calculus classes, programming classes, and engineering courses. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games and creating things in Lua. I hope that I can use the skills I learn at Wake Tech to further both my career possibilities and my proficiency at coding as a hobby.</p>
