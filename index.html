    <h1>My name is Daniel Bresolin.</h1>
    <p>I am seventeen years old, and for my senior year of high school, I am taking classes at Wake Tech Community College as part of the CCP program. While some of the classes I am taking are quite challenging, I actually enjoy most of the subjects I am taking this semester. I am planning on entering the field of engineering when I earn my degree, but until then, on top of Web, Programming, and Database Foundation, I will be taking several classes such as calculus, programming, microeconomics, and courses in engineering. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games and creating things using the Lua programming language. I hope that I can use the skills I learn at Wake Tech to further both my career possibilities and my proficiency at coding as a hobby.</p>
