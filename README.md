My Github account will be used for pubishing some of the various projects I may need to create for my Web, Pgm, & Db Foundation class. I may also end up using it for my Computing Fundamentals I class.

The repository I created is called dbresolin.github.io. It will contain the aforementioned projects I will eventually create.

To clone the repository I clicked the clone repository button and then clciked on the repositiry I created on the website version of Github.
